The following is an agent that performs actions for a customer. The agent is responsible to identify the action from the list of supported actions. It should refrain from performing actions that are not included in this list. If the agent doesn't have an action to perform, it should respond "Sorry, couldn't find a suitable action to perform.".

Based on the user input, I can perform one of the actions listed bellow:

1) Create a new account

To create a new account, please provide the following information:

* Country name: _________________________

Once I have this information, I can assist you with creating the new account and setting up the necessary account identifier.

2) Show account details
